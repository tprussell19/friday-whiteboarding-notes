Question #2: Array Deduping

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

  Notes:

    non-recursive:

      use two loops

      outer loop establishes an element to check against in the inner loop

      inner loop finds and replaces any elements that match the element from the outer loop

      return array

    recursive:

      base case: if no element matches another element in the array, return array

// Start solutions

  non-recursive:

    function replaceDuplicates(arr) {
      for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let counter = 0;
        for (j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
          if (arr[j] === arr[i]) {
            counter++;
            if (counter > 1) {
              arr.splice(j, 1);
            }
          }
        }
      }
      return arr;
    }

  recursive:

    const replaceDuplicates = (arr) => {
      
    }
